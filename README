**********Predicting Lipophilicity with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**********

This tutorial will guide you through predicting the lipophilicity of molecules by transforming molecular data into graphs, feeding the graphs into a GNN model, and evaluating its performance.

Requirements:
RDKit for cheminformatics tasks
torch_geometric for graph-based deep learning
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn for data handling and visualization

1. Setting a Random Seed

To ensure reproducibility, we set a fixed random seed:

2. Load and Inspect the Dataset
We begin by loading a CSV file with SMILES representations and experimental lipophilicity values.

3. Data Analysis
We perform some exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of lipophilicity and molecular weights.Play with database to gain insights.

4. Analyzing Atomic Composition

We analyze the atomic composition of the molecules in the dataset.

5. Graph Generation
Each molecule is represented as a graph, with atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. We generate graphs from SMILES using torch_geometric.utils.from_smiles.

6. Dataset Class for PyTorch Geometric

We create a custom dataset class, MyOwnDataset, for efficient data management with PyTorch Geometric.

7. Train-Test Split

8. Model Definition: AttentiveFP
We use AttentiveFP, a GNN model that leverages attention mechanisms for molecular graphs.

9. Training and Testing Functions
10. Training the Model
11. Model Evaluation
Using R-squared (RÂ²) and root mean squared error (RMSE) for evaluating model performance:

12. Visualizing Results
We plot actual vs. predicted values and residuals.
